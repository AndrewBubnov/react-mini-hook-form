## âœ¨ Key Features

### ðŸ”§ `useForm` Hook
- Provides state management for both **controlled** and **uncontrolled forms**.
- Includes core functions:
  - `register` â€” to register **uncontrolled fields**.
  - `control` â€” to register and manage **controlled fields**.
  - `trigger` â€” to programmatically validate the form.
  - `handleSubmit` â€” to handle form submission.

#### **Validation**
- Validation rules can be provided:
  - Directly to `register`.
  - Via `resolver` when initializing `useForm`.
- Fully compatible with the React Hook Form validation API.
- Supports integration with the **Zod** library through `zodResolver`, which is available from **react-mini-hook-form** to minimize peer dependencies.

#### **Form Modes**
- `onSubmit` (default): validation occurs when the form is submitted.
- `onChange`: triggered after a `trigger` call and validates on every input change.

#### **Returned State (`formState`)**
- `errors` â€” an object containing form errors.
- `isSubmitted` â€” a flag indicating if the form has been submitted.
- `isSubmitting` â€” a flag indicating if the form is in the process of being submitted.
- `isValid` â€” a flag indicating if the form is valid.

    - `append` â€” adds a new field to the end of the array.
    - `prepend` â€” adds a new field to the start of the array.
    - `insert` â€” inserts a field at a specific index.
